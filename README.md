## ⚙️ How overwatch Works

overwatch connects to public and trusted cyber threat feeds and geospatial data providers. As new info comes in, the backend combines it and sends updates to your dashboard. The map updates markers and alerts without needing to refresh the page.

You do not have to configure the data sources. Everything updates automatically for you.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try these solutions:

- **Dashboard does not load:** Check if your internet connection is active. Try refreshing the page or restarting the app.  
- **Map is blank or slow:** Make sure hardware acceleration is enabled in your browser settings. Close other heavy tabs.  
- **No alerts showing:** Confirm filters are not hiding all data. Reset filters to default if unsure.  
- **Notifications don’t appear:** Check your browser’s permission settings to allow notifications from overwatch.  
- **Installation problems:** Redownload the installer file and run it as administrator (Windows) or check security settings (Mac).  

If problems persist, consider visiting the GitHub page or contacting support through the repository issues section.
